# About: Abdul Rehman, 2 2

Welcome to my page.

    I am a master's student at the School of Automation, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, China. My core interests are cognitive computing, HRI/HCI, robotics, abstraction, and randomization. My skills range widely from Python to analog electronics, as I have mostly worked on IoT projects from top to bottom. Currently, I am interested in creating AI algorithms that can sustain themselves in the long run, i.e., adaptive control in the human world.

As a final year grad student, I have been researching on speech emotion recognition and trying to build a real-time end-to-end analyzer. Here is a demo:
